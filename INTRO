programming is an "high level language"which will be understood by us(human beings) but not by the machines.machines will understand only 
0's and 1's.how this will be converted there occurs a huge process 
lets see it one by one....
1.program->pre-processor-this will remove comments and libraries files and explore their content in brief pure high level language->
compiler->assembly language->loading and linking other files eg.,for printf another file will be containing explanation will be done by 
loader and linker.->machine understandable language.that's it.
