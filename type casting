now we r looking about the type casting in c programming is very friendly not like in java 
/*we can either use it explicitely or compiler is going to be do it for you.either for converting
it into big byte to short byte or short byte to long byte 
here,a=b means assigning b to a then int a=(int)b or dont want.
if we are using two variables and passing the funtion var  as int and other one as float then
also we r going to make two var as same data type.bcz,two var pointing to same value.
if we r calculating some mathematical expression we dono what the type the value might return then,we can explicitely say what type it should 
be converted either in int or float or double etc.,
