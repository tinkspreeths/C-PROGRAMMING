here,without variable if the constants are given we shld be able to detect which dtattype it belongs to
if we want a var to be constant always lets say pi=3.14 and we want to use it in several lines of the program then,declare it as
const int pi;
or #define pi;
in 2nd declaration,the preprocesor will change it to as constant that is as value and then it will use it.
