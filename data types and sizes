*we can have datatype variable as --a-z,A-Z,0-9,_,but we cannot start with 0-9or _,in which means inbetween we can have them so,always strt
variable by alphabets either a-z or A-Z.
*datatypes:
$char-each and every character has a 8 bits or 1 byte from 0-255 every decimal will converted into character
$ int-integer size depends on what hardware am i using compiler am i using based on  that.
$float-floating numbers-each should have atleast 32 bits and some other machines can also have beyond 32 bits.->floating point precision.
$double-floating numbers-each should have atleast 64 bits and some other machines can also have beyond 64 bits.->double  precision.

qualifiers:
short int;
long int
short float;
long float
1.short
2.int
3.long

using sizeof(int)we can check the size of our datatypes enrolled in  our system.
